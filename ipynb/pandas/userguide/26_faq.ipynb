    ">>> if pd.Series([False, True, False]):\n",

    "NaN, Integer NA values and NA type promotions\n",
    "Choice of NA representation\n",
    "For lack of NA (missing) support from the ground up in NumPy and Python in general, we were given the difficult choice between either:\n",
    "\n",
    "A masked array solution: an array of data and an array of boolean values indicating whether a value is there or is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a special sentinel value, bit pattern, or set of sentinel values to denote NA across the dtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many reasons we chose the latter. After years of production use it has proven, at least in my opinion, to be the best decision given the state of affairs in NumPy and Python in general. The special value NaN (Not-A-Number) is used everywhere as the NA value, and there are API functions isna and notna which can be used across the dtypes to detect NA values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it comes with it a couple of trade-offs which I most certainly have not ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for integer NA\n",
    "In the absence of high performance NA support being built into NumPy from the ground up, the primary casualty is the ability to represent NAs in integer arrays. For example:\n",

    "While this may seem like a heavy trade-off, I have found very few cases where this is an issue in practice i.e. storing values greater than 2**53. Some explanation for the motivation is in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not make NumPy like R?\n",
    "Many people have suggested that NumPy should simply emulate the NA support present in the more domain-specific statistical programming language R. Part of the reason is the NumPy type hierarchy:\n",

    "\n",
    "numpy.character\n",
    "\n",
    "string_, unicode_\n",
    "\n",
    "The R language, by contrast, only has a handful of built-in data types: integer, numeric (floating-point), character, and boolean. NA types are implemented by reserving special bit patterns for each type to be used as the missing value. While doing this with the full NumPy type hierarchy would be possible, it would be a more substantial trade-off (especially for the 8- and 16-bit data types) and implementation undertaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate approach is that of using masked arrays. A masked array is an array of data with an associated boolean mask denoting whether each value should be considered NA or not. I am personally not in love with this approach as I feel that overall it places a fairly heavy burden on the user and the library implementer. Additionally, it exacts a fairly high performance cost when working with numerical data compared with the simple approach of using NaN. Thus, I have chosen the Pythonic “practicality beats purity” approach and traded integer NA capability for a much simpler approach of using a special value in float and object arrays to denote NA, and promoting integer arrays to floating when NAs must be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences with NumPy\n",
    "For Series and DataFrame objects, var() normalizes by N-1 to produce unbiased estimates of the sample variance, while NumPy’s var normalizes by N, which measures the variance of the sample. Note that cov() normalizes by N-1 in both pandas and NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread-safety\n",
    "As of pandas 0.11, pandas is not 100% thread safe. The known issues relate to the copy() method. If you are doing a lot of copying of DataFrame objects shared among threads, we recommend holding locks inside the threads where the data copying occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "See this link for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte-ordering issues\n",
    "Occasionally you may have to deal with data that were created on a machine with a different byte order than the one on which you are running Python. A common symptom of this issue is an error like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "ValueError: Big-endian buffer not supported on little-endian compiler\n",
    "To deal with this issue you should convert the underlying NumPy array to the native system byte order before passing it to Series or DataFrame constructors using something similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [32]: x = np.array(list(range(10)), \">i4\")  # big endian\n",
    "\n",
    "In [33]: newx = x.byteswap().newbyteorder()  # force native byteorder\n",
