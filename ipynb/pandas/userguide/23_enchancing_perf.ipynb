    "# Enhancing performance\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we will investigate how to speed up certain functions operating on pandas DataFrames using three different techniques: Cython, Numba and pandas.eval(). We will see a speed improvement of ~200 when we use Cython and Numba on a test function operating row-wise on the DataFrame. Using pandas.eval() we will speed up a sum by an order of ~2.\n",

    "Note\n",

In object mode, Numba will execute but your code will not speed up significantly. If you would prefer that Numba throw an error if it cannot compile a function in a way that speeds up your code, pass Numba the argument nopython=True (e.g. @numba.jit(nopython=True)).
