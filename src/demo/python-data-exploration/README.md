# [Python Data Exploration](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/python-data-exploration.git)

This is an example of how to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to explore a given dataset with [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

## Requirements

Obviously you need Python. I'd recommend installing [Anaconda](anaconda.com), which provides you with all the fancy Python data-science libraries.

If you have python installed, make sure to install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), as well as the necessary python packages for Pandas and Seaborn via pip.

You can see the steps in [Exploring Datasets.ipynb](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/python-data-exploration/blob/master/Exploring%20Datasets.ipynb). Github will render the Jupyter Notebooks so you don't have to download it. If you want to try it yourself, feel free to do it inside [Exploring Datasets Yourself.ipynb](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/python-data-exploration/blob/master/Exploring%20Datasets%20Yourself.ipynb).
